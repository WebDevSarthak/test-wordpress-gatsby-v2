Most planners are limited to planning work; however, as a company, we choose to be involved in the whole project. We ensure that reports are contiguous, clear, and concise so that when it reaches the consent authority, they want to approve it.</p>
                                <p class="mt_20">Jeffrey Bulfin is the Principal Planner at Precise Planning, Deep River Groupâ€™s town planning arm. Jeffrey, a highly respected member of the profession, has acted as a witness of the court on several occasions. We have a profound knowledge of planning regulation and law. Our industry relations extend far into local councils, the Department of Planning, Industry and Environment, and the Office of Environment and Heritage.</p>

We have walked the road many times and know how to travel most efficiently, without detours. Additionally, our town planners are also client-facing, which means you're not handing off work to a back office. You are able to count on having a planner available for your advocation, liaison, and presentation. </p>
