                                <p class="mt_20">A Town Planner could be described as a mix of a lawyer, designer, engineer, and surveyor. An expert town planner needs to have an understanding of the entire development industry because we compile your applications to Council. Furthermore, we ensure your project is compliant with all of the relevant legislation such as Local Environmental Plans, Development Control Plans, State Environmental Planning Policies, and various other regulations.</p>
                                <p class="mt_20">Town planners remove the hassle and headache of dealing with Councils, The Department of Planning, Industry and Environment, and various other government organisations. When it comes to development approvals, we know what to do, when to do it, how to get it, and who to get it from. We make the development process smoother, more efficient, and cost-effective.</p>
        
                                <h4 class="mt_20">Do I need a Town Planner?</h4>

                                <p class="mt_20">Many developers initially try to save money by searching for the cheapest town planner they can find, or by preparing development applications themselves. However no development goes perfectly, and the expertise of a good town planner will be invaluable when Council rejects an application, neighbours lodge objections, and when architects provide plans that do not meet design specifications. Moreover, setbacks in the development process can become costly, and this is why engaging a good town planner is essential.</p>
